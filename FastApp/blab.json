 {'name': 'Alan Turing', 'summary': 'Alan Mathison Turing (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912\xa0– 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.[5] He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.[6][7][8] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.[9]', 'main_image': './images/main_summary_of_Alan Turing_image.png', 'links_riddles_and_sub_images': [('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(disambiguation)', ChatCompletionMessage(content="I'm a brilliant mind from Britain's past,\nMathematics and logic - my expertise vast.\nCracking codes and secrets with a keen eye,\nIn the realm of computers, I did fly high.\nWho am I?", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), './images/Turing (disambiguation) - Wikipedia_sub_page_image.png'), ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire', ChatCompletionMessage(content="I am a prestigious honor, bestowed on the deserving few,\nRecognizing achievements in various fields, old and new.\nFrom the arts to sciences, and charity's embrace,\nMy recipients excel, bringing honor to their grace.\nCivil and military, united in my fold,\nKnights and dames of distinction, their stories told.\nThough not a member, the British Empire Medal stands close,\nLinked to my legacy, a symbol of service grandiose.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), './images/Order of the British Empire - Wikipedia_sub_page_image.png'), ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society', ChatCompletionMessage(content='In the realm of wisdom and discovery, I stand tall,\nAcknowledged by those who heed the royal call.\nFor my deeds in natural knowledge, I am adorned,\nIn mathematics, engineering, and science, my path is worn.\nWhat am I?', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), './images/Fellow of the Royal Society - Wikipedia_sub_page_image.png'), ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maida_Vale', ChatCompletionMessage(content="In the west of London's charm you'll find,\nA district affluent, a sight so kind.\nNorth of Paddington, St. John's Wood nearby,\nSouth of Kilburn, where dreams do fly high.\n\nLate Victorian vibes, Edwardian grace,\nBlocks of mansion flats in this special place.\nBBC Studios nestled, where music plays,\nGuess this topic, in the London haze.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), './images/Maida Vale - Wikipedia_sub_page_image.png'), ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow', ChatCompletionMessage(content="In Cheshire's borough, I stand tall,\nA market town, not too small.\nJust south of Manchester, I lay,\nGuess my name, can you say?\nWith folks aplenty, hear me shout,\nMy charm and beauty, there's no doubt.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), './images/Wilmslow - Wikipedia_sub_page_image.png')]}
